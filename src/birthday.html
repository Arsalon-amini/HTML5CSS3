                    Happy 29th Birthday! Time flies, couldn't believe it's been half of a year
                    since we know each other, I still remembered how fast we clicked and how
                    much fun I had dancing with you on that day, holding hands on the
                    sidewalk, enjoying each other's company by the beach, the two truths and a
                    lie and of course couldn’t miss out the ridiculous ferry story and how
                    much we explored each other within a night, that day with you was an
                    adventure and I never want this journey to stop…
              
                    <p></p>
                    <li><strong>SHARED MEMORIES</strong></li>
                    Looking back at it, there were ups and downs that brings us here today, I
                    like spending time with you, I like some moments we’ve shared, with you
                    making me take a quick test the first time when I visit, with you playing
                    guitar, with the candles lit, the music on, the dance moves, with some
                    back rubs, with reading books before bed, with some surprises I left most
                    of the time, with showing vulnerability and more, you teach me so much
                    about life, about us.
              
                    <p></p>
